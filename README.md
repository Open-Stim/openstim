### PROJECT'S GOAL
The main objective of the project is to develop and build a low-cost electrical stimulator
for experimental electrophysiology based on the Arduino platform. The idea is to build a Shield
capable of controlling the output current and keeping it constant even if the load changes, that
is, independent of the animal/tissue being stimulated and possible changes of impedance.

### STIMULATOR PARAMETERS
-Current: 15 µA up to 1200 µA <br/>
-Frequency: 0.1 Hz up to 300 Hz <br/>
-Duty Cycle: 4 µs up to 1 s <br/>
-Biphasic Pulses <br/>
-Low battery indicator <br/>
