### PROJECT'S GOAL
<P align="justify"> The main objective of the project was to develop and build a low-cost electrical stimulator for experimental stimulation electrophysiology
based on the Arduino platform, maximizing ease of use, versatility, and openness. The idea was to develop an output stage shield capable of 
delivering mono or biphasic pulses with constant current (even in face of varying output impedances) easily attachable to an Arduino microcontroller
board. Stimulation parameters (pulse frequency, pulse duration, number and polarity of phases) can be controlled by a touch screen and/or by knobs.
In this entry, we published the version which is controlled mostly by a touch screen display, but this can be easily substituted by manual controls 
(switches and additional knobs) with or without a LCD display to further reduce costs (variation not yet published). These variations and openness of 
the design (which is provisionally certified by OSHWA with UID BR000007) makes Open Stim a very flexible stimulation platform for experienced users and, 
at the same time, also a ready-to-use device for researchers not skilled on electronics. 

### DISCLAIMER
<P align="justify"> We offer this design as is and although it has been successfully tested with care and to the best of our knowledge, we do not provide any 
 warranty in any aspect.
